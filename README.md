# js
This is the base set of eslint rules (and, consequently, style) for JavaScript at Evermind

* Inspired by https://github.com/zeit/eslint-config-base and https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
* eslint is for js linting, prettier is for formatting.

* If you get a warning you are sure you can avoid, be sure to add a comment to prevent it showing up in your console
